SWEPP: Software Engineering Pizza Project
SWEPP is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline the pizza ordering and delivery process for a startup "Mom and Pop" pizza shop. Developed as part of the SWE 3313 (Introduction to Software Engineering) course, this project demonstrates key principles of software engineering, including object-oriented programming, modular design, and practical application of advanced programming techniques.

Features:

Account Management
-User account creation and login functionality.
-Securely stores customer data, including name, phone number, address, and delivery instructions.

Menu and Order Management

-Interactive menu page allowing customers to browse and select items.
-Shopping cart functionality to review and modify orders before checkout.
-Efficient management of order data linked to customer accounts.

Data Storage

-Utilizes local file storage for maintaining customer records and order history.
-Ensures data integrity and accessibility without the need for external databases.

Web Interface

-Built using Blazor for a responsive and user-friendly experience.
-Designed with simplicity and ease of navigation in mind.

Technology Stack
-Frontend: Blazor
-Backend: C# with .NET
-Data Storage: Local file-based storage
-Development Tools: Git for version control

Key Concepts Demonstrated:

Object-Oriented Programming
-Implemented reusable classes (Customer, Order, Pizza) using principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Data Structures:
-Used collections to handle customer records and manage orders effectively.

Modular and Scalable Design:
-Ensured code maintainability through modular design and separation of concerns.

Version Control:
-Leveraged Git for source code management and collaboration.

How to Run the Project
